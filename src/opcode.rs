// Character	Meaning
// >	Increment the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the right).
// <	Decrement the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the left).
// +	Increment the byte at the data pointer by one.
// -	Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one.
// .	Output the byte at the data pointer.
// ,	Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
// [	If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
// ]	If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.[a]
